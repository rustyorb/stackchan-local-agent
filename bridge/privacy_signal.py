"""Privacy LED upload-signal helper.

Tells the firmware "data is leaving the LAN" so it can pulse the
corresponding privacy LED (mic green or camera red). Pairs with the
firmware-side `Privacy` (DataType 0x1A) WS handler in
`firmware/main/hal/hal_ws_avatar.cpp` and the `setMicWanBound` /
`setCameraUploading` API on `PrivacyLeds`.

The signal is *advisory* — the firmware also enforces a 2 s failsafe
timeout on each WAN-bound flag, so a missing `upload_end` (bridge crash,
network hiccup) cannot leave the LED stuck pulsing forever. That makes
this helper deliberately fire-and-forget: if the transport fails, we
log and move on; the firmware self-heals.

TRANSPORT NOTES
---------------

The firmware avatar WS connects to `http://localhost:3000/stackChan/ws`
by default — the upstream M5Stack Go-server endpoint. Today the live
deployment does NOT run that server, so this helper is a no-op-with-log
in production. It is wired into `_call_vision_api` already so that if
the avatar server is ever brought up (or replaced with a bridge-hosted
endpoint), the camera-upload pulse starts working with zero further
bridge changes.

The shape of the API (`signal_camera_upload`, `signal_mic_upload`) is
the chokepoint; transport can be swapped out underneath without
touching `bridge.py`.
