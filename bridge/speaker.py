"""SpeakerResolver — "who is talking to Dotty?".

The resolver is a small, deterministic, dependency-light combiner that
turns four weak signals into a single best-guess `Person` plus a
confidence score. Phase 1 of the family-companion identity work; sits
in front of the LLM call so every voice turn can be grounded in "we're
talking to Hudson, not just _household."

Why combine signals
-------------------
Without on-device face recognition (Layer 4 — pending firmware), no
single signal is reliable:

  - **Self-ID** (utterances like "It's Brett") is unambiguous when
    present, but absent on most turns.
  - **Calendar** (today's `[Person]` events near now) is great in a
    routine household but silent on weekends / unscheduled time.
  - **Time-of-day** prior is cheap and surprisingly accurate for kids
    after school / parents in the evening, but degenerates for any
    non-routine moment.
  - **Perception** (recent `face_detected`) tells us *someone is here*
    even before face_recognized lands; it gates the resolver against
    inventing a speaker when the room is empty.

Each signal contributes a weighted vote; the combiner returns the
top-1 person plus the per-signal evidence that picked them, so we can
audit every decision.

Sticky behaviour
----------------
A self-ID match latches the channel onto that person for
`SPEAKER_STICKY_SEC` (default 600 s). The user's natural behaviour is
to talk to Dotty for several turns in one sitting — re-resolving from
scratch every turn would (a) wobble, (b) drop the user mid-thought if
calendar/time priors disagree. The latch survives ACP session
rotation by living bridge-side. A new self-ID phrase always wins ("no
wait, it's Brett") — so anyone can correct an identification
explicitly.

Privacy
-------
Resolver output is *only* a registry id + the data the registry
already exposes. No raw voice fingerprints, no photos, no biometric-
adjacent material. All decisions persist to a small audit table for
tuning; that table never leaves the ZeroClaw host.

    The resolver is constructed once per bridge process and called

    asyncio sense: shared mutable state (sticky latches, recent
    perception cache) is guarded by a `threading.Lock` so the rare
    cross-thread call (e.g. a dashboard HTTP handler from FastAPI's thread
    pool) doesn't race with voice traffic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    registry :

        resolver always returns the fallback identity. Wiring stays
        simple and a missing/empty registry never breaks the bridge.
    calendar_provider :
        Callable returning the current cached calendar events
        (list of dicts as produced by `_calendar_cache["events"]`).
        Optional. Errors are swallowed.
    perception_provider :
        Callable returning a list of perception events seen recently
        (each a dict with `name`, `ts`, optional `data.identity`).
